	HelpDupSheetAndViews
	>>
	This option will duplicate an existing sheet and all of the elements and views, even those restricted to placement on a single sheet, with detailing.  Also, due to Revit® limitations, the viewport title will match the original but cannot be positioned to match the original.

	If the current view is a sheet, the sheet is pre-selected as the sheet to be duplicated.

	To duplicate a sheet and views:
	1.  (Optional): Open a sheet view
	2.  Select "Duplicate Sheet and Views" from the list of Operations
	3.  (Optional): Set the "New Sheet Options" (options are persistent)
	4.  (Optional): Set the "New View Name Options"
	5.  Select a sheet to be duplicated
	6.  (Optional): Indicate the number of copies (default is one, maximum is 99)
	7.  (Optional): Choose a title block to use for the new sheets.
		 The default is the same title block from the sheet 
		 being duplicated

	Select cancel to not duplicate the sheet and exit.

	Select OK to duplicate the sheet and views.  The selected sheet and views will be duplicated one or more times.  The duplicate sheet(s) will be given a sheet number and name based on the "New Sheet Options."  The duplicated views will be given a name based on the "New Sheet Options."

	If checked, the sheet's parameters, including custom parameters, from the original sheet are duplicated.

	Undo is supported.  All sheets duplicated in a single operation will be removed with a single undo.

The format for the sequential number, that is minimum number of digits (zero filled), is determined by the number format drop down.  The sequential number start with the "Sequence #" provided in the "New Sheet Name Format" section below except the actual sheet number will be the first available, since duplicate sheet numbers are not allowed.

	The divider character may be nothing, a preset character (a space, a period, or a dash), or a custom character.
	The suffix must be one of the following:
	- A sequential number with one of four formats (minimum number of zero filled digits)
	- A lower case letter (a, b, c ... z, aa, ab, etc.)
	- An upper case letter (A, B, C ... Z, AA, Ab, etc.)
